"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" introduces readers to Harry Potter, an orphan who lives a miserable life with his abusive relatives, the Dursleys. On his eleventh birthday, Harry discovers that he is a wizard when he receives an invitation to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The letter is delivered by Hagrid, the groundskeeper at Hogwarts, who takes Harry shopping for school supplies at a magical place called Diagon Alley, where Harry learns more about his past and his famous status in the wizarding world.

At Hogwarts, Harry quickly makes friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and finds himself in Gryffindor house. He also discovers a talent for flying on broomsticks and is recruited into his house's Quidditch team as a Seeker. As the school year progresses, Harry, Ron, and Hermione uncover the mystery of the Sorcerer's Stone, an ancient artifact with the power to grant eternal life and turn any metal into pure gold.

The trio learns that the stone is being kept at Hogwarts, protected by magical enchantments. They suspect that someone is trying to steal it, and they believe it is Professor Snape, one of the teachers. Determined to prevent the stone from falling into the wrong hands, they bypass the protective enchantments themselves. To their surprise, they confront not Snape but Professor Quirrell, who has been sharing his body with Voldemort in an attempt to keep Voldemort alive and help him regain power.

Harry manages to prevent Voldemort from getting the stone, which is subsequently destroyed by Dumbledore to prevent its powers from being misused. The school year ends with Gryffindor winning the house cup, and Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer, looking forward to his next year at Hogwarts.
