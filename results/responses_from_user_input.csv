Introduction:
Mark Twain, born Samuel Langhorne Clemens on November 30, 1835, in the small river town of Florida, Missouri, would rise to become one of America's most renowned literary icons.  His sharp wit, sprawling narratives, and deep social commentary have earned him an indelible place in the annals of global literature.

 Chapter 1: The Early Years
Samuel Clemens's journey began modestly, as the sixth child in a family of seven.  His early years in Hannibal, Missouri, would later provide the setting for some of his most famous works.  When young Clemens was just eleven, his father passed away, leaving the family in financial straits and forcing Samuel to leave school and start working as a printer's apprentice.

 Chapter 2: Life on the Mississippi
Clemens's fascination with the Mississippi River led him to a career as a steamboat pilot, a rich experience that would later inform his pen name—Mark Twain, a term signifying two fathoms deep, safe water for boats.  However, the Civil War disrupted river traffic, and Clemens had to set his piloting aspirations aside.
